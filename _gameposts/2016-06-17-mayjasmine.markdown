Just played [Mayjasmine episode01: What is God](http://store.steampowered.com/app/417110/). The game is not at all what you expect. You are expecting a standard VN, but insted you end up with a history lesson on the [indonesian riots in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia).

I seriously recommend playing it. Geniunely good and interesting story.

You play from the point of view of a taiwanese man who has been hooked up with a job at a factory as a accountant. You live with your best friend and his rude daughter.
